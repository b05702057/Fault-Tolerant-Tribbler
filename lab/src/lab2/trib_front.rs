///
/// -----------Registration, Checking for user existence, and list_users()--------
///
/// - Below describes the workflow and steps needed to register. Read everything since
///   the reasoning for these steps are not necessarily explained in the beginning.
///
/// - The workflow path for any user request differs whether
///   cached_sorted_list_users is < MIN_LIST_USER or >= MIN_LIST_USER.
///
/// - For sign up, if cached_sorted_list_users < MIN_LIST_USER:
///     - Check the source of truth location to see if user is already signed up.
///       The source of truth or commit point for a registration is done by using
///       the bin whose name is equal to the user we are setting up, and then setting the
///       USER_EXISTS_KEY to "true". If the user is already in there, then return error
///       UsernameTaken. Otherwise continue with below.
///     - Retrieve the registration list (which will only be for the first MIN_LIST_USER
///       users) from predefined location. This location's bin name is
///       EARLY_REGISTRATION_BIN_NAME and list key is EARLY_REGISTRATION_LOG_KEY.
///       The registration status can be evaluated by looking at each field and checking
///       the "commit_status" of the entry. If it is undetermined, then check the source
///       of truth / commit location (read on to see how) and update the field. Then only
///       those with "commit_status" = committed will be considered registered. Make sure
///       to account for duplicate registrations for the same user in the evaluation, since
///       this is possible the (i.e. only consider  duplicate registration as 1 registration
///       count).
///     - Check if that list is already MIN_LIST_USER registered after evaluation. ONLY IF
///       that evaluation is not already MIN_LIST_USER do we do the following:
///           - Create/append a placeholder entry in that list resistration for the
///             first MIN_LIST_USER registrations. This placeholder entry's validity is not
///             yet confirmed (until the registration commit status is determined).
///     - Now we can commit the registration by setting the source of truth. Notice that it
///       is possible for concurrent registration commits for the same user may happen
///       and both return successful for sign_up, but this is allowed by the requirements.
///       Sequential sign up for the same user will be prevented though (by the first step when
///       checking the source of truth).
///     - If we previously created a placeholder in the registration list, then now is the
///       time to set its commit status to true. If this fails or front end shuts down, no issue.
///     - Note the front end could optionally cache the retrieved registration list in
///       cached_sorted_list_users in sign_up(). This is not required to achieve the requirements
///       since list_users() will be responsible for populating this cache as well.
///     - Note the creation of placeholder entry is needed in case we crash before we committed,
///       we can refer to the source of truth for commit status. This is because we have 2 info
///       related to registrations in different places (registration list and source of truth
///       locations). Because the commit action needs to be only 1 write and we want to
///       efficiently lookup if the user exists especially later on, we choose the bin name
///       being user and USER_EXISTS_CACHE_KEY location to be the source of truth (only 1 source
///       of truth possible given requirements).
///     - This registration list is needed because calls to list_user() will defer to this if
///       cached_sorted_list_users is not at MIN_LIST_USER length yet. Otherwise, list_user()
///       has no way to determine registered users (unless by guessing all possible usernames and
///       checking those bins for existence, which would be unrealistic). Hence we have the 2
///       registration info locations.
///     - Since list_user() only neeeds at most MIN_LIST_USER, once registration list evaluates
///       to 20 registered, there is no longer a need to append to it for sign_up. See below:
///
/// - For sign up, if cached_sorted_list_users >= MIN_LIST_USER:
///     - Simply check the source of truth to see if user is already signed up. If yes, return
///       UsernameTaken error. If not directly commit to source of truth location. Again,
///       concurrent registrations for the same user is possible, but allowed by requirements.
///
/// - Thus, to check user existence, only need to go to the source of truth. Simple!
///
/// - List users will have to do something similar to sign_up tho:
///     - If cached_sorted_list_users < MIN_LIST_USER:
///         - Similar procedure to a part seen in sign_up case. Check and evaluate the registration
///           list. Update the cached_sorted_list_users. Return result.
///     - Else (if cached_sorted_list_users >= MIN_LIST_USER):
///         - Just return cache.
///
///
/// -----------------------------Which bin to use for requests?------------------------------
/// - All actions for a user/who (instead of whom) such as adding to a user's posts or
///   follow action list will be done in a bin whose name is the user's username.
/// - This method brings some guarantees. First, all said operations for a user will be
///   on the same bin, and thus same backend. This means the clock() function is always
///   gives advancing values for sequential calls; e.g. we can guarantee properties such as:
///     "If tribble A is posted after tribble B, and they are both posted by the same user,
///     A always shows after B", where
///     "A is posted after B means A calls post() after Bâ€™s post() has returned."
///   This is important since sequential clock() on different bins does not guarantee
///   advancing values (since keeper syncing backends frequency is not infinitely fast).
/// - This method also allows us to take advantage of properties to do things such as
///   resolve concurrent following actions taken by a user (see Following/Unfollowing)
///   since all actions of user is in the same bin / backend, whose values will be used
///   as serialization order.
///
///
/// (Read previous section first to see how bin usage gives properties we utilize here)
/// Following/Unfollowing:
/// - A per user log of both following and unfollowing actions (both in the same log per
///   user) is maintained. The storage key to this log is FOLLOWING_ACTION_LIST_KEY.
/// - The order of the entries in the log is the serialization guaranteed by the storage
///   and thus clients should use it as source of truth when resolving any races. Note,
///   the clock number associated is used for unique identifying purposes and not the
///   serialization order. In particular a log (action, logical_time) could have something
///   like:
///     ..., (unfollow C, 12), (follow B, 15), (follow B, 13).
///     Note the logical time need not be sorted and is not used for serialization ordering
///     in the following actions log.
/// - These actions are uniquely identified by their logical clock value, which is unique
///   since it will be generated by clock()
/// - Example of concurrency and how we deal with races:
///   If two A follow B requests occurs concurrently and is appended to A's log, then
///   only the one that is closest to the last action seen action on B (or beginning of
///   log if none exists) in A's log when we first fetched it should return successful to
///   the browser request.
///     - For example: Say A's log (action, logical_time) entries is currently:
///         Log: ..., (unfollow B, 10), (follow C, 12)
///     - Now 2 requests see that we can follow B, leading to execution of 2 concurrent appends:
///         Log: ..., (unfollow B, 10), (follow C, 12), (follow B, 15), (follow B, 13)
///     - Then, only the client that appended (follow B, 15) should return successful, since
///       it is closer to the last action on B i.e. (unfollow B, 10).
///     - Thus, when processing a request, we should fetch the log, save this last
///       action (unfollow B, 10) before appending, and then refetch the log to see the situation.
///     - Note when fetching the lock, we only check for races on the same user and
///       the same type as our action. In this case, the concurrent follow request senders should
///       only check if any follow actions (and ignore unfollow) are in between them and their
///       prior save of last relevant action (i.e. (unfollow B, 10))
///     - This concept applies both to follow and unfollow requests (but check for race actions
///       of same type only). See below for more explanations.
/// - IMPORTANT: We only check for races of the same action type (follow/unfollow) as the
///   action type we are processing in between us and the last seen action.
///     - For example: Say A's log (action, logical_time) entries is currently:
///         Log: ..., (follow B, 10)
///     - Now we append (unfollow B, 11), but this is the resulting og:
///         Log: ..., (follow B, 10), (follow B, 14), (unfollow B, 11)
///     - How could ther be a (follow B 14) in between? Well concurrent appends could lead to
///       this result, and the first time we fetched the log happened to be before the
///       (follow B, 14) reached and written in the log.
///     - Now note this (unfollow B, 11) should still be considered successful. So we cannot
///       consider (follow B, 14) to be a concurrent race that "beat" us to serialization.
///     - Thus when checking for any races, only check on same action. I.e. only if our log was
///       something like this after append, then yes, we lost to a concurrent request:
///         Log: ..., (follow B, 10), (follow B, 14), (unfollow B, 12), (unfollow B, 11)
///         The (unfollow B, 11) is beaten by (unfollow B, 12) since it is the same action as ours
///         and is in between (unfollow B, 11) and the last action noted on B when first reading
///         log i.e. (follow B, 10)
/// - Note again in the examples only the last same action type on the same user B is checked for
///   races, not on any user since we want to allow concurrent following/unfollowing action on
///   different users (e.g. A follow B and A follow C) to succeed.
/// - Side note: Naturally the last saved action before we determine that we can append will be
///   opposite to ours (e.g. we wouldn't unfollow someone we haven't followed and vice versa).
///   This property is not required for the correctness of the race checking we described.
/// - Garbage collection is described in the follow() and
///   garbage_collect_following_log_if_needed() functions
///
///
/// ----------------------------------Tribs, Posting, and Home----------------------------------
/// - For each user, their tribs are stored in their own bin as a list with storage key being
///   TRIBS_LIST_KEY. They are uniquely identified (within each user's list) by logical time.
/// - The order in which to display tribs is the Tribble Order (see write up), which prioritizes
///   logical timestamp unlike the case for the follow/unfollow actions log.
/// - This is because concurrent posts are fine in any order, as long as that order stays
///   consistent for user. Thus, this makes it easy to just sort all posts based on logical clock,
///   especially when used in home() and sorting with other users' (potential on other backends)
///   posts as well (assuming keeper keeps backends roughly in sync). This consistent sorting of
///   tribs, prioritizing logical timestamps, allow us to satisfy both requirement 2 and
///   requirement 3 for home() in the writeup:
///         Requirement 2:    (satisisfied thanks to rough synchronization by keeper)
///         - If tribble A is posted at least 10 seconds after tribble B, even if they are posted
///           by different users, A always shows after B.
///         Requirement 3:    (satisfied thanks to consistent/deterministic sorting order)
///         - If tribble A is posted after a user client sees tribble B, A always shows after B.
/// - Note the requirement that sequential (non-concurrent) posts by the same user is still
///   achieved since all posts for a user go to the trib list in their own bin implying it goes
///   through the same backend, and thus the logical timestamp retrieved ensures absolute
///   uniqueness in logical clock() values. Thus if user posted tribB sequentially after tribA
///   then tribA will always have lower/earlier logical timestamp. This satisfies requirement 1
///   for home() in the writeup:
///         Requirement 1:
///         - If tribble A is posted after tribble B, and they are both posted by the same user,
///           A always shows after B. A is posted after B means A calls post() after Bâ€™s post()
///           has returned.
/// - Although as described requirement 2 is satisfied from just this sorting property, we can
///   improve the experience of the user by calling x <= clock(max_clock_seen_by_user) on the bin
///   and use the result x as our logical time to have things be closer to actual ordering of
///   events across DIFFERENT users posts in the real world. This is because there may be duplicate
///   logical time of posts across different users' posts that we don't have within only one user's
///   posts list.
///   Note we need to call clock() anyway to get a unique (within the the user's trib list) logical
///   time for our trib so this does not cost performance. max_clock_seen_by_user is the the clock
///   field passed to us when user calls post().
///
/// - Garbage collection is considered outdated tribs is done once TRIBS_GARBAGE_COLLECT_THRESHOLD
///   in length is surpassed upon a post. Note "considered" is because even after passing this
///   threshold (which must be >= MAX_TRIB_FETCH, ideally somewhat > MAX_TRIB_FETCH to avoid
///   the threshold being passed every post after MAX_TRIB_FETCH), there is only a 1 in
///   TRIBS_GARBAGE_COLLECTION_CHANCE_PARAMETER chance that the garbage collection request is carried
///   out. This is to avoid having all successive posts of a user to constantly do garbage collection
///   of mostly the same outdated keys and prevents inundation of repeated requests to the user's bin.

        // - The first case is obvious that it is fine to declare the operation successful.

        //    - Say we want to unfollow B (same concept applies to follow, but use unfollow as ex here).
        //    - We first fetch log and see:
        //         ..., (following B, 10)
        //    - We save (following B, 10) as last relevant actionl. However, the log could have been
        //      concurrently appended with a non-racing action to ours and become:
        //         ..., (following B, 10), (following B, 12)
        //    - Then when we append our action, say (unfollow B, 14) we get:
        //         ..., (following B, 10), (following B, 12), (unfollow B, 14)
        //    - At the same time garbage collector comes and removes (following B, 10) (and possibly
        //      (following B, 12) as well).
        //    - Then when we refetch the log, the saved (following B, 10) is missing.
        //    - Thus, as long as there is no racing condition in between us and the beginning of the log
        //      our (unfollow B, 14) as is the case here, our unfollow should still be allowed to succeed.
        //    - The same concept applies to the opposite case when we try to follow.
